You're right to ask! While the previous learning path covers the foundations and hands-on work with generative and agentic AI, **it does not go deeply into model deployment, building APIs around AI models, and serving those models in production**. Here’s a **complete, detailed learning roadmap** including **deployment, API building, cloud/containerization, and serving AI models**—all with verified, up-to-date, free resources for 2025. You can copy and use this as your precise guide.

- **Notebooks:** Experiment with model code locally and on cloud (Colab, Kaggle, HF Spaces)

## 5. **Model Deployment & Serving (How to Build APIs Around Your Models)**
### a) **Core Concepts**
- What is model deployment? — Offline vs. online inference, scaling, REST APIs, batch jobs.
- Common serving patterns: REST API, gRPC, batch, serverless.

### b) **Model Serving Frameworks & Tutorials**
- **fastapi-tutorial (Official):**  
  - [Google Search: FastAPI Tutorial]  
  - Build REST APIs in Python, ideal for serving ML/GenAI models.
- **TensorFlow Serving** (if using TensorFlow models):  
  - [Google: TensorFlow Serving Guide]
- **TorchServe** (for PyTorch):  
  - [Google: TorchServe Tutorial]
- **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints/Spaces:**  
  - [Google: Hugging Face Model Deployment]
- **MLflow Models/Serving:**  
  - [Google: MLflow Serve Model Tutorial]
- **LangChain (for agentic/LLM apps):**  
  - Quickstarts for deploying LLM chains and APIs.
- **OpenAI API Reference** (for hosted LLMs):  
  - Learn to build your own API layer around models.

### c) **Step-by-Step Tutorials**

## 6. **Containers, Cloud & Productionization**
- **Docker Deep Learning Model Serving:**
  - [Docker for ML Model Deployment Tutorials]  
  - Package your FastAPI/Flask/Streamlit or TorchServe service as a Docker image.
- **Deploying on Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure):**
  - Free credits for students—deploy ML APIs on cloud (search "[Cloud] Free ML deployment tutorial").
- **CI/CD for ML:**  
  - Introduction to GitHub Actions, MLflow for pipeline automation.

## 7. **Open-Source Agent Frameworks & API-Ready Projects (GEN/AGI)**
- **LangChain** (Python) and **LlamaIndex**:  
  - Building agents, chains, and production API endpoints for LLMs (search: "LangChain API deployment").
- **DJL (Deep Java Library):** If staying in Java, use DJL for deployment, or build APIs with Spring Boot + DJL.

## 8. **Testing & Monitoring**
- How to test your deployed AI APIs (unit/integration tests, latency and throughput)
- Model drift, logging, versioning (search: "ML model monitoring open source")

## 9. **End-to-End Example Projects**
